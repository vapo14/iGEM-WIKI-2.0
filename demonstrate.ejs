                In order to test the antifungal activity of our peptides as well as prove their viability as a mechanism
                to inhibit <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, an antifungal susceptibility test on a 96 well plate was carried
                out by
                measuring absorbance at 405 nm, wavelength used in standardized protocols to measure growth of
                filamentous fungi1. Due to a lack of time, we couldn’t reach the experimental stage of the project of
                peptide purification, so experiments were made using soluble protein extracts from our transformed
                cells’ lysates. Different dilutions of the extracts were prepared which were applied to a spore
                suspension of V. dahliae. Dilutions of the extracts of untransformed cells were used as controls to
                prove that inhibition was the result of the peptides and not any other protein contained within the
                extract. Soluble proteins from each chassis was used, BL21 (DE3) were as control for the AtPFN1 extract,
                and SHuffle extract as control for both PsDef1 and WAMP1b. Concentrations of extracts with peptides were
                equalized to their controls. The tables 1 and 2 detail the concentrations of each dilution.

                96 well plates were prepared as shown in Figure 1. A final volume of 200 μL was completed in each well
                by mixing protein extract, sterile distilled water (to achieve desired concentrations), potato dextrose
                broth, and a spore suspension of <i>V. dahliae</i> with a final concentration of 2x104 spores/mL per

                Results generated by the previous formula correspond to the percentage in which absorbance increased in
                each
                well compared to the initial reading. The results are summarized in figures 2, 3, and 4. Through a
                careful
                interpretation, a pattern was observed for all peptides tested. As the figures show, an outstanding
                difference in growth values exists among the positive growth controls without any kind of protein
                extract,
                the untransformed strain extract controls, and the growth of the fungus with different peptides’
                concentrations, was noted. The positive control was estimated to grow at a rate of 40.36% after 24 h, on
                the
                other hand, the lowest concentrations of added protein extracts clearly showed a decreasing behavior in
                growth rates. In comparison, growth rates from wells containing protein extracts of untransformed cells
                do
                not behave this way, meaning that all three peptides had a degree of inhibition against V. dahliae, even
                in
                crude extract. In order to better comprehend the results, growth rates were used to estimate the
                percentage
                of inhibition using the following formula:
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <i>I = 100 - (Gp / Gv) 100</i>

                where:
                I = inhibition % <br>
                Gp = Growth rate of <i>V. dahliae</i> treated with extract with peptides. <br>

                Untransformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) protein extracts seemed to increase the fungus’ growth in contrast with
                the extract containing the AtPFN1 peptide, which demonstrated inhibition in all three dilutions with the
                exception of the undiluted extract. The inhibition percentages for this peptide were of 30.40%, 76.96%,
                and 98.32% for dilutions 3:4, 1:2, and 1:4 respectively in comparison with the positive growth control.
                This assay was able to demonstrate the peptide’s reported ability to permeabilize the cell wall and
                membrane of fungal spores(cita) by showing growth reduction in almost all dilutions and close to total

                In comparison, the two highest concentrations of extracts with peptides (1 & 3:4) seemed to show a
                greater growth than the positive controls, even though previous results showed that the extracts were
                capable of inhibiting the fungus growth. Analyzing this lead to the opportunity of identifying error
                sources and troubleshooting this protocol.The remarkable difference from the positive control wells and
                those with our protein extract dilutions opens their interpretation based on several hypotheses.
            </p>
            <p>

                Due to the time, equipment, and material limitations we encountered, the antifungal assays presented
                show preliminary results. Delving further into this, we concluded that a factor we could have overlooked
                in the design of this protocol was the possibility of compound precipitation. A common occurrence in
                microplates assays is the precipitation of the inhibitory components, which leads to inconsistent
                inhibition values.2 Peptides tend to precipitate at certain concentrations, depending on their
                composition, solubility and even the buffer or medium they’re diluted in.2, 3 Given that we have almost
                no concrete information about our peptides, and that we saw ourselves forced to use crude extract,
                precipitation at the highest concentrations we used is a feasible possibility. It has been remarked in
                literature that this incidence makes it almost impossible to determine the MIC (Minimal Inhibitory
                Concentration) through this method.2
            </p>
            <p>
                The precipitation of our peptides could have affected the optic density measurements causing variations
                that altered the overall results.3 Or, most likely, the precipitation altered the inhibitory effect of
                our peptides at high concentrations. This is a common occurrence, and recommendations can be found
                through literature, research papers, and protocol manuals.4 One of them is keeping the plates in
                agitation to avoid or minimize this effect, but in other cases agitating the plates lead to confusing
                outcomes.2, 3 Since we never considered agitation necessary for our protocol, this is a potential
                modification to consider for future tests. Another option is trying different media or buffers, to
                decrease or completely avoid precipitation.4
