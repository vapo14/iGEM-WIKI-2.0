                    <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a parasitic, filamentous fungus that affects more than 300 species,
                    cotton
                    being one
                    of the most commonly affected.<sup><a href="#DesRef1">1</a></sup> It attacks the plant’s vascular
                    system,
                    using it to spread through the
                    whole plant. After a while, the mycelium clogs the vascular system and causes the whole plant to
                    wilt. This
                    is known as Verticillium wilt, and it is responsible for annual losses from 0.5% up to 5% in some
                    states of
                    the U.S.<sup><a href="#DesRef2">2</a></sup>

                    Our project’s purpose is to create a product using three different peptides (WAMP1b, AtPFN1, and
                    PsDef1)
                    that attack <i>V. dahliae</i> at different stages of its life cycle as an alternative to the current
                    roundabout
                    methods used to treat this fungus, since there is no fungicide produced specifically for <i>V.
                        dahliae</i>.
                    Those
                    methods result harmful to the plants that they are trying to protect, the soil beneath them, and the
                    land
                    around them.<sup><a href="#DesRef3">3</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since our end goal is to develop a product, we needed to know the optimal concentrations of our
                    peptides,
                    since an oversaturated concentration of peptides would be costly and potentially detrimental to
                    plant
                    health, and and insufficient concentration could do no effect on fungal growth inhibition. From this
                    problem, we designed our mathematical model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a 96 well protocol and Gompertz equation, we were able to plot <i>V. dahliae</i> growth curve
                    to determine its maximal growth rate and lag time. We applied a similar methodology to to perform an
                    inhibition assay with a known antifungal agent in order to develop the steps necessary to determine
                    IC<sub>50</sub>. This process will be applied to our peptides once they are purified to estimate the
                    optimal concentration in our product to reduce costs and assure effectiveness.

                    Our model seeks to find an optimal concentration of our peptides to effectively and efficiently
                    inhibit
                    <i>V. dahliae’s</i> growth. To do this we first needed information on our fungus’s growth kinetics.
                    However,
                    not much has been documented about <i>V. dahliae</i>’s growth. Since we needed that information, we
                    first
                    had to define <i>V. dahliae</i>’s growth curve. Once we had that data, we could differentiate it to
                    its
                    growth with different concentrations of our peptides. After that evaluation of Relative
                    IC<sub>50</sub> of each
                    of our
                    peptides was planned to get an adequate concentration for WAMP1b, AtPFN1, and PsDef1.
                    Due to the complexity of the project and the limited amount of time, we knew that
                    purification of
                    our
                    peptides was possibly unattainable. Therefore, we designed a methodology to generate a model
                    that
                    could work
                    as the basis for the determination of the optimal concentration of our peptides. To do so we
                    decided
                    to use
                    a general fungicide with benzimidazole as its active ingredient.

                    This gives our model two goals: <b>Modelling the growth of <i>Verticillium dahliae</i></b>, and
                    <b>Modelling

                    There are many different ways to model the growth of an organism. A popular method and the fist one
                    we found
                    was Monod’s Equation . It expresses rate of growth (μ) as a function of substrate concentration (S)
                    in which
                    max states that there is a point where growth stops accelerating and reaches a maximum growth speed
                    and a
                    point midway through the exponential growth phase (K<sub>S</sub>).<sup><a
                            href="#DesRef4">4</a></sup> Though
                    the equation can be applied to growth models, we realized it was too simple for what we needed, and
                    the
                    concentration of growth substrate wasn’t relevant for our experiment. Thus, we started searching for
                    a more
                    specific equation that could describe fungal growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found many morphologically structured models that had parameters representing different
                    morphological
                    properties of a fungus like average hyphae length, hyphae count, diameter. However, we discovered
                    that rate
                    of growth from dry mass was one of the most commonly used techniques for measuring fungal growth in
                    these
                    models, but we realized that this methodology although accurate, is tedious, time consuming and was
                    not
                    applicable to large-scale, multivariable, multireplicate experimentation <sup><a
                            href="#DesRef5">5</a></sup>
                    and since our sample size would be too small to measure with traditional methods, obtaining that
                    parameter
                    would also be impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering that we couldn’t measure relevant parameters directly, our Mathematical Model advisor
                    suggested
                    an abstraction of data. Instead of measuring any morphological parameters, we could measure
                    <b>optical
                        density</b> with a spectrophotometric assay. Also using microtiter plates in combination with a
                    microplate reader is more efficient for growth experiments with filamentous fungi because it is
                    extremely
                    fast, reliable, and requires as little as 75 ~ul of total culture volume. Furthermore, this
                    measurement
                    helps with screening for antifungal agents, antifungal drug susceptibility testing, and
                    physiological growth
                    experiments.<sup><a href="#DesRef6">6</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking into account that the best idea was to work with optical density, we decided to use spore
                    suspension
                    as inoculum due to the relation that culture absorbance has with fungal biomass and also that
                    relative
                    standard deviation of absorbance measurements are usually lower when spores are used as
                    inoculum.<sup><a href="#DesRef7">7</a></sup>

                    After measuring our fungus’ growths, we had to fit the equation to our data. We could easily
                    determine two of our parameters since they were our first reading (y<sub>0</sub>) and our range (C).
                    However,
                    we were still missing Maximum Growth Rate (μ) and Lag Time (λ). To find these parameters, we
                    developed a MATLAB program that would take two initial estimates (we could infer these by
                    looking at
                    the data points), graphing the equation, and solving by a least squares regression method.
                    After
                    running the program a few times, changing our estimates with what the program returned, we
                    were able
                    to determine our growth curve:

                    In <b>Figure 1</b>, we can appreciate the growth curve of <i>V. dahliae</i>. Each point represents
                    one of the ten
                    absorbance measurements done through five days. The curve presents the characteristic sigmoidal
                    shape of microbial growth where the lag, exponential, and stationary phases can be clearly
                    visualized. As determined by the Gompertz equation, the lag phase <b>&lambda;</b> was calculated to
                    be 33.467 h and
                    the maximum growth rate <b>μ </b>was calculated to be 0.104 OD/h. These points can be observed on
                    the

                    As previously mentioned, our end goal is to develop a product with optimal concentrations of our

                    would
                    allow us to mathematically analyze the inhibition of each of our peptides in a near future, a growth
                    inhibition assay against <i>V. dahliae</i> was carried out using a chemical with known activity
                    against
                    filamentous fungi. Its active ingredient is benzimidazole. An initial antifungal solution was
                    prepared
                    with a concentration of 250 μg/mL, as recommended by the provider in order to produce complete
                    inhibition, and nine further 1:2 serial dilutions were prepared. Solutions were transferred to a 96
                    well
                    plate, as well as a spore suspension of <i>V. dahliae</i> and liquid media to complete a final

                    made
                    for each dilution, a final concentration of 2x10<sup>4</sup> spores/mL was used, plates were
                    incubated
                    at 25°C, and
                    absorbance readings at 405 nm on a Varioskan Lux 3020-231 microplate reader were performed twice a

                    During our research we found that when optimal inhibition was required, a measure of effectiveness
                    called IC<sub>50</sub> was commonly used. This is used to evaluate the performance of substances
                    when
                    working with
                    inhibition. For our final equation we needed to determine relative IC<sub>50</sub> which is the

                    concentration from the most inhibition (upper plateaus) to the least inhibition (lower plateaus).<a

                    The best way to determine IC<sub>50</sub> is through a model that includes this resource as a
                    parameter,
                    for
                    example the 4-parameter logistic model. This model is capable of describing the sigmoidal pattern

                    To find our missing our missing parameters, first we ran our Gompertz Optimization program for each
                    dilution, got their respective μ’s and plotted them in respect to the inhibitor concentration. We
                    plotted these data in order to analyze it, and yet again, we had two known parameters (a,d), our
                    independent variable (X), and two unknown parameters (b,c). Since the problem was the same, we did
                    the same procedure we had done to find Gompertz’s μ and λ, changing the equation from the
                    optimization program for our inhibition equation (4). We did this for a few cycles and were able to
                    determine our missing parameters and insert them into our equation:

                    To plot our data, we adjusted the X-axis to a logarithmic scale in order to accurately represent our
                    data since it would be too steep otherwise. Once we had found our inhibition parameters, we saw that
                    our IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.921 μg/mL. The model worked as expected seeing that the closest measured
                    concentration
                    to produce an inhibition close to 50% was 15.6250 μg/mL with a 51.1795% of inhibition. This
                    point
                    can be visualized in figure 2 close to the IC<sub>50</sub>. It is clear that little

                    needed to
                    inhibit <i>V. dahliae’s</i> growth effectively, compared to the original concentration of
                    250 μg/mL
                    recommended by the supplier. This exemplifies the practicality of this model to estimate a

                    Our experiments proved the idea we had developed about our model. They served as a proof of concept
                    on how we would determine the IC<sub>50</sub> for our peptides once they are purified and extracted.
                    This would
                    be very valuable on other parts of the project, such as Entrepreneurship to reduce production costs
                    and optimize concentrations. Also, determining <i>V. dahliae’s</i> growth kinetics allows us to get
                    a
                    deeper understanding on how it grows, and could lead to other applications for its control.
