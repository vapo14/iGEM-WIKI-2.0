                    The first link of the VC is the cropping of cotton, and is encompassed all the way to the cotton
                    bud. This
                    is
                    mainly harvested for its fiber and seeds, either for the production of textiles or of by-products
                    used to
                    obtain
                    oil, paper and livestock feed. Although in some areas cotton cropping has been mechanized, the vast
                    majority
                    (especially with small producers) it is still customary to hire personnel for planting. So during
                    this stage
                    it
                    has been reported a generation of almost 4 million direct wage jobs and approximately 9 million
                    indirect
                    wage
                    jobs. These numbers refer solely to Mexico, now, can you imagine around the whole world?
                </p>
                <p>

                    Plant diseases like Verticillium wilt cause a decrease in production, and as a result of this,
                    producers
                    have to
                    make staff reductions, which closes the main source of income for thousands of families.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, in this sector we can identify as main actors both producers and agronomic engineers.

            <div id="harvestcontainer">
                <p>
                    After the cotton buds, the next stage is the harvest/pinch. This can be carried out either with
                    machinery or by hand. When using machinery, the producer benefits since a smaller number of people
                    per
                    hectare must be hired; around 7 people overall. On the other hand, a manual harvest provides higher
                    quality cotton and up to 25 people are needed per hectare. In most cases, these jobs are the only
                    support for the worker’s family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once again, the main actors of this sector are the producers.

            <div id="ginningcontainer">
                <p>
                    After the harvest, a ginning machine is responsible for extracting the cotton leaving the capsule
                    empty.
                    The fiber obtained through this process still has seeds (it is known as raw cotton).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being a fully mechanized process, producers usually deliver their product to a cotton ginner, where
                    this
                    task is carried out.<sup>1</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, in this sector, cotton ginners are identified as one of the main stakeholders.

            <div id="deseedcontainer">
                <p>
                    Immediately after ginning, the raw cotton is taken to a shaker to separate the seeds from the fiber
                    to
                    finally obtain raw cotton. However, the amount obtained is only between 35 to 40%.<sup>1</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Small ginners, such as the ginner Del Desierto in Delicias, Chihuahua, employ around 15 people. It
                    is
                    known that the amount of employers, and consequently depending families, is proportional to the
                    ginner’s
                    size.

                    Cotton fiber can be sent to the United States Department of Agriculture or an expert visits the
                    region,
                    to evaluate the fiber’s quality. Its price depends on the stocks value and the evaluation of certain
                    characteristics, like elasticity and thickness. However, phytopathogenic fungi such as Verticillium
                    dahliae are able to reduce its quality and therefore its price.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At a national level, the textile and clothing industry generates more than half a million jobs, and
                    a
                    significant amount of exports; $ 4,695 million pesos. However, in the last couple of years the
                    number of
                    imports exceeded that of exports.<sup>2,3</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, in addition to the jobs cotton generates, it can greatly impact a country’s economy.
                    Thus, textile industries are recognized as one of our stakeholders.

                    At the end of the ginning, the remaining 60 or 65% of the product consists of seeds, short fibers -
                    called borras - and garbage. Usually, the seed is processed to obtain cattle feed, the short fibers
                    are
                    treated to produce high quality bond paper, used as a source of cellulose for the chemical industry,
                    and
                    the resulting garbage is sometimes reused as a fertilizer for the same cotton fields. Even if this
                    tries
                    to ensure an effective use of the whole product, it can generate a vicious circle in which the
                    spores of
                    the phytopathogenic fungus V. dahliae return to the ground.

                    Bernardo is an agronomic producer who manages around 90 ha of cotton. He’s suffered strong economic
                    losses due to Verticillium wilt. His previous rescue option was using transgenic seeds, but
                    unfortunately they were banned this year.

                <p>
                    He has no knowledge of any product that attacks this disease effectively, but he shared with us the
                    fact that he doesn’t like to use chemicals because he fears for his family’s health.

                <p>
                    He’s been aware of <i>Verticillium</i> for 10 years, and even today he considers it the most
                    problematic
                    disease regarding cotton plants. To try to inhibit it, he’s resorted to the use of triazoles (ex.
                    Pointer, Sparta) which are agrochemical pesticides, as recommended by his technical advisor; the
                    technical advisor is in charge of advice and supervise crops.

                    Bernardo is a producer of the agricultural region of Janos, who counts cotton as one of his main
                    crops. He shared with us that he sows 180 ha of cotton, and that after the harvest, it’s of great
                    importance to assess the quality of the fiber because its commercial price depends on that. Further
                    on he sadly recognized that <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> has caused the bale yield to decrease in
                    recent
                    years. Despite the fact that he’s been aware of the disease for the past 7 years, he still hasn’t
                    found a product capable of eradicating this fungus. He also shared with us that it’s easier for him
                    to apply a product through irrigation. Finally he mentioned that for any inconvenience he stumbles
                    upon, he relies fully on his technical advisor.

                    Adam has worked his whole life on family crops, and in the past few years he has identified
                    Verticillium wilt as one of the main problems in cotton fields. His production has been reduced from
                    12 bales per hectare, to only 8.

                <p>
                    Despite his attempts of eradicating it with diverse products, he hasn’t succeeded yet. He also
                    shared with us how application of diverse products through irrigation is the simplest for them.

                    Year after year, producer Alfonso Blancas obtained a yield of 14 bales maximum and 7 bales minimum
                    per hectare. However, since 2014, Verticillium wilt has affected his production, reducing it to 5 or

                <h5>"I bet on the area of ​​biopesticides, it is a core part of the future." </h5>
                <p>
                    Dr. Layla counts with a Doctorate in Environmental Science and Technology and belongs to the
                    National System of Investigators, with a current status of investigator level 1. In addition to
                    this, she has extensive experience working with phytopathogenic fungi. She has been extremely
                    helpful to the development of our project, so much that she became part of our team as an
                    instructor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From her experience in the area, he stated that <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is an exceptionally
                    difficult
                    fungus to treat and, due to lack of information, farmers allocate the symptoms of their diseased
                    crops to other pathogens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, she shared with us that in our city (Chihuahua, Chihuahua), once there existed successful
                    textile companies, but in the 70s there was a strong crisis in the state’s cotton production due to
                    <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. This resulted in the closure of these businesses. A relevant example of
                    this
                    is the DemTex company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She also informed us that there is no treating fungicide against <i>Verticillium</i> and that she
                    suggests
                    the creation of a systemic product to fight it due to <i>V.dahliae</i> accts systematically. However
                    one of
                    the drawbacks of systemic pesticides is that the current ones don’t travel more than 15 cm from the
                    ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Considering this, she thinks that the best possible option is a preventive fungicide, since it is
                    cheaper and more practical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s worth mentioning that she emphasized how sadly chemical pesticides are often used to commit
                    suicide in rural communities, and how using biological products contributes greatly to preventing
                    this.

                <p>
                    The engineer Carlos García is in charge of supervising several crops from Colonia Buena Vista,
                    Janos. Throughout the years he’s came to the conclusion that cotton holds the greatest importance
                    for both agriculture and families' economy. He has known about <i>Verticillium</i> wilt for years,
                    and
                    although there are several crops susceptible to the fungus, cotton is the most affected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Annually, losses of 15% to 20% had been noticed, but due to the lack of disease-resistant seeds this
                    year, greater losses are expected. In addition to this, there is no effective product against <i>
                        V.
                        dahliae.
                    </i> Therefore he has opted for triazoles to try to inhibit it, but it is not yet known if it
                    will work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, low fiber prices aren’t an incentive for investments to be made to control
                    <i>Verticillium</i>; which
                    is a shame because it is not possible to detect the disease until it’s impossible to rescue the
                    crop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was very kind in telling us that for a product to reach cotton’s roots it’s essential to apply it
                    halfway through irrigation. On average, an irrigation period lasts 6 hours, and for a product to
                    doesn’t remain in the surface of the tank’s flow, the flow should be turned off half an hour before
                    the period ends. Finally, based on his experience, he knows that for each cotton hectare, around
                    25m<sup>3</sup> of water are required.

                    approximately, $1500 dlls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the use of products based on antagonic microorganisms, their effect doesn’t last long and
                    further on the crops are vulnerable to fungi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if transgenic seeds are an option for cost reduction, in the country only two commercial brands
                    are distributed, and unfortunately, this year acquiring them wasn’t possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to crop rotation, other products such as peanut and chili, become vulnerable to Verticillium
                    wilt.

                <p>
                    He also shared with us that a producer’s choice to buy a product is greatly guided by their
                    technical assessor. Then he told us that the assessors choose pesticides based on their
                    effectiveness, leaving the price consideration aside.

                <p>
                    For <i>Verticillium</i>, he informed us that irrigation through bands and pivots is important
                    because
                    fungicide reaches the roots. Also, irrigation time has to be considered when water is rising by
                    capillarity, to optimize the product’s delivery method.

                <p>
                    Right now, they are using triazoles, which attack both beneficial and pathogenic fungi.

                    planted.
                </p>


                <p>
                    During this season, of the hectares he supervises, a 10% has been affected. To treat this, he
                    resorted
                    to the use of triazoles, but since they are not effective, they end up being too expensive. As for
                    the
                    kind of products they use, they prefer liquid products given their effective solubility.

                    He was very kind to share with us his opinion on transgenic products:

                    “They present higher effectiveness; this reduces the amount of pesticides needed, which are very
                    harmful
                    to health and the environment. It is also of utmost importance to not exceed their use, since if

                    improperly, they can cause the plant to develop resistance to certain diseases.”

                <p>

                <p>
                    In the meeting with the Eng. Alfonso Soto, we learned that cotton is one of the most important crops
                    and
                    that 95% of them in our state are located at the northern and northwestern zone of the state of
                    Chihuahua.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Products derived from cotton crops are, mostly, sold to the national textile companies of Puebla,
                    Estado
                    de Mexico, and Hidalgo, as well as exported to countries like Pakistan, China, Japan, and
                    Afghanistan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He confirmed the presence of Verticillium dahliae on cotton and chili crops. Usually, to inhibit
                    this
                    type of pathogens, transgenic seeds are used, however, the government only supported producers to
                    purchase them 2 years ago.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cotton can be classified according to its resistance, micro, and fiber length. Unfortunately,
                    Verticillium wilt is capable of affecting any of these parameters, decreasing its selling price.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He also told us that there isn’t a lot of information about the issue because authorities do not
                    give it
                    the importance it deserves. It is assumed that because Chihuahua has such a great production, it
                    does
                    not suffer from important pathogens in its crops, however, there are many marginal zones in the
                    state
                    who desperately need support.

                    He is a manager at the ginner “Del Desierto” in the city of Delicias, Chihuahua. Despite producing
                    up to 22,000 bales, the production has decreased in the past 3 years.

                <p>
                    The final product is exported inside the country. If production continues to decrease, there is a
                    high chance that textile companies in Mexico start importing a larger amount of cotton from other
                    countries. Likewise, the jobs of the 50 people that work at the ginner would be at risk.

                                While explaining to us the action mechanism of the fungus Verticillium dahliae, Dr.
                                Layla
                                emphasized
                                its systematic approach. She also briefly explained the advantages that a preventive
                                fungicide
                                has,
                                as it helps prevent possible losses. This was confirmed during our visit to INIFAP. So,
                                choosing
                                our
                                peptides, we considered the fact that V. dahliae remains as spores in the soil, and the
                                action
                                mechanism of AtPFN1, where it attacks the cell membrane of spores, gives it preventive
                                qualities.
                                Further on, through interviews with the producers we learned they didn’t notice the

                                until it
                                was considerably late. Here is where our two other peptides (WAMP1b and PsDef1) appear.
                                Their

                                remarked how a fungicide’s application tends to be simpler with irrigation. Application

                                designed to be applied through irrigation was the best option.

                                irrigation was the poor dissolution it had in water. What this caused was that a larger

                                of product was needed to achieve the desired efficiency. Some time later, engineer

                                Engineer Carlos shared his unconformity about how fungicides with biological active
                                ingredients have a short period of effectiveness. Given that our active ingredients were
                                peptides, we realized we had to ensure a considerable protection for them if we wanted
                                our fungicide to have a high yield when it reached the roots. Through an extensive
                                bibliographic consultation, we came to the conclusion that nanoencapsulating our
                                peptides was the best option. One of the advantages of nanoencapsulation is that it
                                offers a prolonged release. Initially, given its natural character pectin was our first
                                choice; pectin is a soluble polymer that can be found in every terrestrial plant’s
                                meristematic tissue, so it is not toxic for the environment, also it has been used to
                                encapsulate peptides.

                                3 hours after irrigation begins and is turned off half an hour before it ends to avoid

                    One of the main problems acknowledged by the Team through the Project’s legal analysis was its
                    correct legal classification. This classification is especially relevant, since it is necessary to
                    know the requirements and concepts handled by the competent authority, since scientific and
                    technical terms may vary in laws and regulations, generating confusion in who conducts research or
                    develops projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Based on the foregoing, on September 18, 2019, a Technical Request of Information was filed at
                    COFEPRIS (Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks), in order to request
                    information from such authority for the correct classification of the Product.

                    As noted in the attached document, it is important that the Project complies with all regulations in
                    this area. In order to reinforce the Project with the above, a Risk Analysis and Assessment document
                    has been created, and it contains all necessary provisions to ensure that the Product is produced,
                    marketed and released into the environment, complying with all of the necessary regulations.

                    documents, diverse national and international protocols and Official Mexican Standards (NOMs) have
                    been consulted for the implementation of recommendations in the Project.

                    Given that the Project may have an environmental and economic impact in the future, it has been
                    projected also as company. The Mexican legal system requires companies to be incorporated before a
                    Notary Public, so a company’s incorporation project (including bylaws) has been generated, so that,
                    at any time, the Project can acquire the necessary formality required by law.

                    Likewise, an analysis of “V-TION” as a trademark was made at IMPI (Mexican Trademark Authority).
                    This
                    document analyzes the possible interferences or problems that may arise when trying to register the
                    “V-TION” as a registered trademark. The protection of trademarks in Mexico, in recent years, has
                    increased greatly, as companies and individuals have become aware that trademarks are the most
                    important
                    intangible asset they may have when entering into a competitive market.

                    Also, in order to know the value of the Project in the market, a Letter of Intent format has been
                    generated, so that people interested in knowing or implementing the Product express, without binding
                    effects, their intention to acquire the Product in the future. It is important to note that this
                    document does not constitute an obligation (or liability) between the parties.
