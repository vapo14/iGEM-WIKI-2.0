        <p>
            <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is a parasitic, filamentous fungus that affects more than 300 species, cotton
            being one
            of the most commonly affected.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> It attacks the plant’s vascular system, using
            it to spread through the
            whole plant. After a while, the mycelium clogs the vascular system and causes the whole plant to wilt. This
            is known as <i>Verticillium Wilt</i>, and it is responsible for annual losses from 0.5% up to 5% in some
            states of
            the U.S.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Our project’s purpose is to create a product using three different peptides (WAMP1b, AtPFN1, and PsDef1)
            that attack <i>V. dahliae</i> at different stages of its life cycle as an alternative to the current
            roundabout
            methods used to treat this fungus, since there is no fungicide produced specifically for <i>V. dahliae</i>.
            Those
            methods result harmful to the plants that they are trying to protect, the soil beneath them, and the land
            around them.<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since our end goal is to develop a product, we needed to know the optimal concentrations of our peptides,
            since
            an oversaturated concentration of peptides would be costly and potentially detrimental to plant health, and
            and
            insufficient concentration could do no effect on fungal growth inhibition. From this problem, we designed
            our
            mathematical model.
        </p>

        <h1 id="Our-Model">Our Model</h1>
        <p>
            Our model seeks to find an optimal concentration of our peptides to effectively and efficiently inhibit <i>
                V.
                dahliae’s
            </i> growth. To do this we first needed information on our fungus’s growth kinetics. However, not much
            has been documented about <i>V. dahliae</i>’s growth. Since we needed that information, we first had to
            <strong>
                define <i>
                    V.
                    dahliae
                </i>’s growth curve
            </strong>. Once we had that information, we could <strong>
                differentiate it to its growth with different
                concentrations of our peptides
            </strong>. After that we evaluate the <strong>Relative IC<sub>50</sub> of each of our peptides</strong> to
            get an
            adequate concentration for our peptides.
        </p>

        <p>
            This gives our model two goals: <strong>Modelling the growth of <i>Verticilium dahliae</i> dahliae</strong>,
            and <strong>
                Modelling our peptides’
                inhibition
            </strong>.
        </p>

        <h1 id="Modelling-Growth">Modelling the growth of <i>Verticilium dahliae</i></h1>
        <p>
            There are many different ways to model the growth of an organism. A popular method is applying Monod’s
            Equation [MONOD IMG HERE]. It expresses rate of growth(μ) as a function of substrate concentration(S) in
            which max
            states that there is a point where growth stops accelerating and reaches a maximum growth speed
            (μ<sub>max</sub>) and a point
            midway through the exponential growth phase (K<sub>S</sub>).<sup><a href="#ref4">4</a></sup> Though the
            equation can be applied to growth models, we
            realized it was too simple for what we needed, and the concentration of growth substrate wasn’t relevant for
            our experiment. Thus, we started searching for a more specific equation that could describe fungal growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            We found many morphologically structured models that had parameters representing different morphological
            properties of a fungus like avg. hyphae length, hyphae count, diameter. However, we didn’t have the
            equipment necessary to measure those parameters, and there are practically no publications documenting them
            for <i>V. dahliae</i>. Looking for an alternative we discovered that we could get rate of growth from dry
            mass
            which is one of the most commonly used parameters for measuring fungal growth, but since our sample size
            would be too small to measure with traditional methods, obtaining that parameter would also be impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since we couldn’t measure relevant parameters directly, our Mathematical Model advisor suggested an
            abstraction of data. Instead of measuring any morphological parameters, we could measure Optical Density
            with a spectrophotometric assay. This idea came up after finding a paper comparing different mathematical
            models’ accuracy measuring the growth of microbial colonies by absorbance and plate count methods. After
            comparing the models, one of them seemed to be our best bet for our own implementation, the <strong>
                Gompertz
                Equation
            </strong>.<sup><a href="#ref5">5</a></sup>
        </p>

        <h1 id="Gompertz">Gompertz Equation</h1>
        <p>
            The Gompertz Growth Curve was first published in 1825 in the <i>
                Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
                Society
            </i>. Although its original purpose was to detail a law of human mortality where a man’s resistance to
            death diminished as time increased, it has since been used as a growth curve for biological and economic
            phenomena.<sup><a href="#ref6">6</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            In the investigation that compared different models’ accuracy, Gompertz’s equation was expressed like so:
        </p>
        [GOMPERTZ IMG]

        <p>
            Where:<br>
            y: Absorbance (OD)<br>
            y0: Initial Absorbance (OD)<br>
            C: Range (ymax - y0)<br>
            μ: Maximum Growth Rate (OD/h)<br>
            λ: Lag Time (h)<br>
            t: Time (h)
        </p>

        <p>
            Using Gompertz’s equation to model <i>V. dahliae</i>’s growth is favorable because the parameters can be
            determined
            by analyzing our data, instead of it working with an arbitrary constant.
