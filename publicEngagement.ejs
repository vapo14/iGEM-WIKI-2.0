                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    It is truly impressive to think that around nine months ago this adventure called iGEM began; and
                    that when the team formed none of us had any idea what Synthetic Biology really was. Now, after so
                    much effort and growth, we are still impressed with the number of its applications and its
                    considerable impact on society and all that it involves. Still, when we reflected upon everything we
                    have learned, we realized it is not enough, or fair, that only 18 university students and the
                    experts in the area who helped us, count with the privilege of this knowledge.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This is why one of the most important goals for our team was to have a meaningful impact on our
                    communities knowledge and opportunities. We aimed to inspire people to participate, contribute, and
                    grow. With this in mind, we took on the task of developing a work plan in the Public Engagement
                    area. On this page you will be able to learn about what the team did along the competition to spread
                    education on the topic and take a step forward to approach our community to Synthetic Biology.

                </p>

                <p>
                    This work plan is based on the goal of bringing Synthetic Biology to as many people as possible
                    through different approaches:
                </p>

                <h2><a href="#Education">Education Model</a></h2>
                <p>This approach consists of giving a series of workshops and presentations to children, teenagers and
                    adults in educational institutions, from elementary schools to graduate degrees. The main goal was
                    to inspire them not only to pursuing a future related to science, but also to continue growing
                    academically and personally. In addition to this, we decided to create a manual to help future iGEM
                    teams to reach students from different education levels and expand their impact. With the creation
                    of this manual we developed a collaboration with Team BUAP.
                </p>


                <h2><a href="#Conferences">Conferences</a></h2>
                <p>This approach consisted of giving talks in different events where students, professors, experts in
                    the field of agriculture, state authorities, and people not-related to science assisted. What we
                    aimed for was for the attendees to have a clearer idea about what Synthetic Biology really is and
                    why is it so important in education and society’s development.
                </p>


                <h2><a href="#UN-Models">United Nations Models</a></h2>
                <p>This approach consisted of bringing the topic of Synthetic Biology to three UN models where it can
                    evolve into an open dialogue about its applications and implications. What we were looking for was
                    that both students and professors with no major scientific background could soak themselves of
                    information about this topic, and to apply it in their area, as well as being able to properly
                    discuss topics with biological factors and their impact on our world.
                </p>


                <h2><a href="#More">More, more & more</a></h2>
                <p>Other series of approaches consisted on attending a convention of another crop affected by V. dahliae
                    where lots of people from the agricultural business gathered. We also made an appearance on a
                    television channel and wrote an editorial article for a magazine. In both of these cases we sought
                    the proper diffusion of Synthetic Biology alongside our project. Finally, a student group was
                    created in order to impact our own school and spread our work with other students, professors and
                    faculty.

            <div class="container">
                <h1>Education</h1><br>
                <div id="Edu-Overview">
                    <p>Researching about education in Mexico we realized that only 18.6% of the population has the
                        privilege of attending a university and concluding their professional education.<sup><a
                                href="#ref1">1</a></sup>
                        This is an impressively low figure that demonstrates a major problem in our society and the
                        situation that Mexican students go through.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This made us realize that we, as university students and participants of the iGEM competition,
                        are more than privileged to have the means and support to do this. So, just as we have been very
                        fortunate to learn about Synthetic Biology throughout our project, we feel a strong need to give
                        back what we have learned to other students in our community. We are aware that this will not
                        solve the Mexican education model, but at least we wish to inspire students to pursue a
                        professional education. We also look forward to contributing to the social mortgage we have as
                        students of our institution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another problem we detected is the lack of scientific dissemination in rural areas, which
                        unfortunately are lagging behind, not only because of their geographical location but also for
                        cultural issues. In these areas, aside from problems due to the lack of efficient means of
                        communication, there are ethnic groups, with a considerable population, who do not speak
                        spanish. This situation encouraged us even more to approach the areas of Guachochi and Nuevo
                        Casas Grandes in our own State. We believe that sharing with these students our work and
                        introducing them to science and a branch of it such as Synthetic Biology, was important for
                        promoting access to quality information and the inclusion of these groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Besides this, we wanted to take advantage of the fact that children at an early age have an
                        amazing capacity for learning, assimilating new ideas, as well as an unbeatable creativity, a
                        much needed quality in today’s world. As for adolescents and young adults, we are intimately
                        aware of the situation they are going through, with so many questions about their future, so
                        little information about the numerous options, and many important decisions to make. This
                        allowed and encouraged us to apply our vision at all educational levels, from primary school to
                        graduate degrees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We wish to add that while designing the workshops, the type of language was carefully selected,
                        since it is very different to work with small children, teenagers, or professional adults.

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        This summer we had the incredible opportunity to give a synthetic biology introductory workshop
                        to several groups of children from public elementary schools in our city. The Escuela Primaria
                        Federal Mariano Valenzuela Ceballo and Escuela Primaria Luis Pasteur were kind enough to allow
                        us to work with a total of 140 of their students.
                    </p>
                    <p>The workshop was divided into two main sections. The first one consisted of an introduction to
                        science and Synthetic Biology. Our goal was to explain how science is important to develop high
                        impact projects for our community and how synthetic biology can be a useful element to get
                        there. We also talked about what entrepreneurship is and how can it be related to Synthetic
                        Biology. Working with children posed a bit of a challenge, since we had to design the workshop
                        and our explanations in such a way that was simple and understandable for them but also fun and
                        got our point across. To achieve this, we explained the concepts with a game using blocks, where
                        we told them how some animals and plants have superpowers (the blocks), and that by sharing it
                        with another animal or plant, they could acquire that superpower and therefore develop the same
                        abilities. We also shared some simple but attractive examples, like the fluorescent rabbit and
                        fruits that change colors and flavors. In order to get them to understand the concept of
                        entrepreneurship, we told them that is was about how a group of people shared an idea that could
                        evolve into a company that gave them money, but that for this to work everyone should respect
                        everyone’s ideas, since they were a single team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part consisted of a small entrepreneurship dynamic where the kids had to develop
                        their own project idea using science and synthetic biology to solve a problem they considered
                        important and try and sell it to us. Finally, they presented their ideas, listing the problem
                        they wanted to solve, their proposed solution, and even the expected price and customers. We
                        were amazed by the kids’ imagination and good understanding of the activity. Our judgement
                        criteria to choose the winners were how well did they understand the principles of synthetic
                        biology, that they could explain to us why was the problem they were solving important, that
                        they knew who they could sell it to, and an approximate price.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the winning ideas were</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="body-list">A turtle that kept in its shell all the species in danger of extinction.
                        </li>
                        <li class="body-list">Fruits that could grow in just one day.
                        </li>
                        <li class="body-list">An air purifier that worked with actual leaves from trees.
                        </li>
                        <li class="body-list">A medicine that combined the properties of both jellyfish and lizards.
                        </li>
                        <li class="body-list">A type of leech that could suck the disease out from people.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The winners received from us lots of candy and a diploma signed by our school’s student groups’
                        manager.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the workshop we talked with the teachers that accompanied us, and they commented
                        that activities like the one we did are very motivating for the kids because they explore their
                        creative abilities and learn new things with unusual dynamics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we were saying goodbye, some of the kids were really happy because they had so much fun and
                        enjoyed the experience. They wouldn’t let us go without a hug and a thank you accompanied by a
                        smile.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is not unknown that working with children poses a bit of a challenge, and, honestly, we did
                        not know what to expect. However, at the end of the day we were amazed by the kids’ imagination
                        and good understanding of the activity. Many of them were impressed by the potential of science,
                        especially because they learned their “crazy” ideas could be achieved. Right now we have no
                        doubt they will be great scientists someday.

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        During this Fall term, we had the opportunity to visit two middle schools (Academia Juárez and
                        Secundaria Estatal 3044) and one high school (Esfer Salesianos), where we gave the presentation
                        “Por
                        qué debería estudiar ciencias biológicas?” (“Why should I study Biological sciences?”), where we
                        reached a total of 361 people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This event consisted of a presentation by some of our team members, which was divided into two
                        parts. During the first one we talked about was is science as a whole, next we deepened into
                        biology
                        and its many branches and the advantages of pursuing a career in biological sciences. Here we
                        were
                        especially interested to hear what the students had to say, we wanted to know their opinions on
                        science and what interested them from it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For the second part, we delved into topics a bit more advances, like what is Synthetic Biology
                        and
                        what applications does it have. Here we focused on giving examples more advanced than those on
                        the
                        primary schools. Therefore we talked about golden rice and the plague specific pesticides.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After discussing about Synthetic BIology is, we talked about our project and how we plan to
                        develop
                        a product available for our state’s market and that also has a positive impact in our community.
                        We
                        also mentioned the iGEM competition, explaining what it is about, what it aims for and how a new
                        team can be built every year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To close our presentation we gave them a list of universities and majors focused on biological
                        sciences both in the state and the country. Aside from this, we gave them some information about
                        associations that offer scholarships for professional level education. Besides focusing our talk
                        to
                        the vocational ambit, we emphasized how the main goal of science is to solve real world issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While we were talking to the groups of teenagers, we realized they were more than interested and
                        had
                        so many questions about science. That is how an expected 30 minute long talk became an hour long
                        one. Most of them inquired about what scientists do and what are the benefits of working in the
                        science field, and we couldn’t be happier to explain.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It’s worth mentioning our experience in a particular high school, the Academia Juarez. To take
                        our
                        presentation to this school we had to travel to Nuevo Casas Grandes where we wanted to help
                        these
                        young students who were far from the states main cities. This was an especially challenging
                        situation, since their educational model is very different from ours. They work with a more
                        american
                        system, which meant we had to exit our comfort zone to effectively share our experiences and get
                        our
                        point across.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>
                        We still remember when we were almost out of high school, about to enter university and take the
                        first step into our professional development. To be very honest, we were far from sure about
                        what we were doing. We had so many questions about what major to seek, what possibilities
                        existed for us, and what could we do. It was a special pleasure to help people probably in that
                        same situation we went through.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nowadays, it’s easier to learn about new things online, but nevertheless, we believe the impact
                        it’s different when someone stands in front of you and talks about their own experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We left all three presentations feeling exhilarated by their genuine interest. For us, the most
                        important part we gave them was listening to their doubts and concerns, and plant in them the
                        importance and transcendence of science. Weeks after we received texts from some of them making
                        even more questions about biology courses. This was so exciting for us because it meant our
                        presentation was useful to some degree.

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        We visited the “Universidad Tecnológica de la Tarahumara (UTT)” located in Guachochi (part of
                        the Sierra Tarahumara) and the Universidad Politécnica de Chihuahua, where we presented the talk
                        “¿Cómo aplicar Biología SIntética en mi área profesional?” (“How to apply Synthetic Biology in
                        your professional area?”). Among the 75 people we reached were students from the following
                        majors: Sustainable and Protected Agriculture, Environmental Technology and Sustainable Forest
                        Management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        First we introduced Synthetic Biology, what it is and what applications its has on their
                        different areas. In order to do this in the best possible way, we looked for specific projects
                        with impact on their areas of interest, some of them were: biosensors, transgenic seeds,
                        synthetic fertilizers, issues like ecotoxicity, metallic ions pollution, the energy crisis and
                        the greenhouse effect. We focused each example about how Synthetic Biology is proposing
                        alternative solutions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We also talked about how their major can implement Synthetic Biology to develop novel ideas, how
                        it is being used to help our environment, and some general information about the iGEM
                        competition and some iGEM projects with further development in the field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then we mentioned some organizations that promote science and offer scholarships for graduate
                        courses in different universities known for excelling in scientific research. At the end we had
                        a chance to talk about the project we are working on this year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aside from talking about the topics we wanted to cover we were interested in hearing their ideas
                        for projects related to their field, and all the questions they had in mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was a very gratifying experience in all aspects. It’s worth mentioning that something that
                        really stuck with us was the visit to the UTT because they had null knowledge about this
                        discipline, given its rural location.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        At the end, the students and faculty members that attended were very interested in the
                        competition
                        and asked us several questions. After inquiring about the requirements and initial
                        processes, they
                        said they would consider joining the competition as a new team next year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We were so excited to hear they are interested in forming a new team for the competition.
                        With their
                        involvement in the environmental field, we know they could do something impactful for the
                        environment, which is an important area of the competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to this, we had the opportunity to talk with the university’s rector Carlos
                        Chávez and
                        contact him with Dr. Alberto Aguilar (Director of the Faculty of Engineering in our campus).
                        This
                        was carried out with the objective of creating a major relationship between the universities
                        both
                        socially and academically. The UTT is relatively new and many people have no knowledge of
                        its
                        existence. We are more than happy to contribute to its growth as an institution.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>
                    <p>
                        In September we gave a presentation titled “El alcance de la Biología Sintética” (“The Scope of
                        Synthetic Biology”), at the Universidad Autónoma de Chihuahua (UACH), our State University. The
                        attendees of this brief conference were 35 graduate students in Science in Biotechnology, Food
                        Technology and Chemistry. We began our conference with an introduction to Synthetic Biology and
                        the
                        advantages it poses. Then we gave some examples, more advanced than those from our previous
                        presentations, which included: biofuels, industrial enzymes, antibodies and vaccines production,
                        plants improvement, pesticides and production of biological based chemicals.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were enthusiastic when sharing what is iGEM and emphasized that it has a special category for
                        graduate students. Then we talked about our project, where we explained the problem we are
                        focused
                        on, our proposed solution, our methodology, our expected results and the importance of other
                        areas,
                        like Human Practices and Entrepreneurship.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This time we had yet another welcome surprise. Our initial expectation was that the presentation
                        would take most of our time in the university, but we received a lot of questions, feedback and
                        advice, especially about how to make our work more integral. Among the advice they insisted upon
                        were: consider the crystallization technique for our product’s delivery, develop a full cost
                        analysis to fully dimension our product’s impact on the market, improve our presentation of the
                        problem to reinforce our project’s impact, and deepen our research on the interaction among the
                        peptides and the cotton plant.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end, we were happy for the feedback but also for the open interest, some were even
                        inquiring
                        about iGEM and how they could be part of the competition.

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes we tend to confine ourselves into what we already know and follow the path based
                        solely on
                        our own knowledge. Nonetheless, it can lead to losing opportunities. Synthetic Biology is a
                        recent
                        branch of science that allows us to go way beyond our current knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were really excited to help students take into consideration Synthetic Biology as an option
                        for
                        their current or future research. Just as much, we were thankful for all the comments they had
                        for
                        us, since they opened our eyes to several areas of opportunity in our project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What we liked the most was since they are older and more experienced students, presenting to
                        them
                        was challenging. We believe that this experience somehow helped us prepare for our final
                        presentation in Boston
                    </p>.

                    <h3>Education Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        There is no doubt this was the series of activities our team enjoyed the most. We had the
                        absolute
                        pleasure of meeting lots of remarkable people, for which we had to prepare ourselves in
                        different
                        ways, since we delved into different cultures, languages, ages and social sectors. The results
                        we
                        obtained were better than we could imagine, everyone was kind enough to share their time with us
                        and
                        show genuine interest in what we had to say. We firmly believe we could impact and inspire, at
                        least
                        a little bit, all of those people. But even more impressive is just how much we learned from the
                        whole experience. Our initial mindset led us to believe our audiences were going to learn so
                        much,
                        but what actually happened was that we were the ones that had more to learn from them. The
                        amazing
                        thing was that we didn’t learn only about science, but also about how to relate, interact and
                        respect others and their ideas. Another highly important thing that surprised us was just how
                        much
                        potential our state’s students have in them to develop any project they think of.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are incredibly grateful to all the people who made this activity possible.

                <h1>Manual</h1><br>
                <p>All that we learned during these visits inspired us to invest an extra effort into developing
                    a manual
                    where we explain in detail how did we approach students from different education levels. Our
                    goal is to
                    make this manual public, so that future iGEM teams can use it as a reference and source of
                    advice on how
                    to do this. The idea was born from how we heard about many of the other teams choose to
                    approach schools
                    in their nearby community because it’s an accessible and feasible audience. Nonetheless, not
                    all teams
                    have this chance and tools to approach various educational levels, like we had the fortune
                    to. This is
                    why we created a manual titled “How to reach students from different education levels?”.

                        This year we decided we would reach beyond the academic youth. We wanted to include in our plans
                        not only students from different levels, but also their most essential and personal tool, their
                        professors. We, as students, are aware that professors are a huge support in a student’s journey
                        to develop both professional and personal skills. </p>

                    <p>
                        For this approach, we focused on students and professors outside the classroom, since our goal
                        was to include those with a particular interest in science and those who participate in events
                        promoting it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is the main reason we wanted to participate in different events of this sort and work with
                        different NGOs dedicated to spreading science, where science lovers, students, their teachers
                        and other authorities are involved.

                    <p>
                        We had the incredible opportunity of participating in the First International Congress of
                        Agricultural Education where we gave a 20 minute presentation titled “Inhibición el hongo
                        Verticillium Dahliae por Biología Sintética” (“Inhibition of the fungus Verticillium dahliae
                        through Synthetic Biology”). This event was organized by the Asociación Mexicana de Educación
                        Agrícola Superior (Mexican Association of Higher Agricultural Education) (AMEAS) on June 19th
                        and 20th Around 130 people from different parts of Mexico and Colombia attended, including
                        professors and students from the agricultural area, agronomists, State authorities, and other
                        people not related to agriculture but with a focus on education.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our talk began with an introduction to Synthetic Biology and how different disciplines converge
                        for its development. In order to explain it more clearly, we talked about one of its most
                        important components, genetic engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To introduce our project, the first thing we mentioned was how we were participating in the iGEM
                        competition and what it’s focused on. Then we talked about the past editions we’ve participated
                        in, to finally explain the problem we had detected this year and the solution we were
                        developing. For us it was very important to highlight the importance of the problem and our
                        methodology, since having experts as part of the audience allowed us to extract extremely useful
                        information for our work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the end of our presentation we answered some questions from experts, and also received
                        substantial feedback. The recommendations went from giving us tips on our wording choices, all
                        the way to offering us laboratory contacts that could help us improve the development of our
                        project.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>
                        After our presentation we had the fortune of meeting some experts in our field of interest. They
                        provided us with valuable information about an event in which we later participated, the World
                        Convention of Pepper. We also had an especially inspiring conversation with Dr. Addy Anchondo,
                        who told us about the Tarahumara university students and the confrontations they suffered. This
                        motivated us to travel to Guachochi to talk with the UTT students.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From what we could detect with this event, many of the professors knew the general concept of
                        what Synthetic Biology is, but they did not have such a clear precedent of the applications that
                        are currently being developed. Therefore, we were very pleased to share with them what we had
                        learned. We hope we could make an impact in their perspective of Synthetic Biology and perhaps
                        in the way they practice it in the near future with their students.

                    <p>
                        On May 31st, we were granted the opportunity to give a brief conference to 130 people about
                        synthetic biology on the “Beautiful Patterns” program. This is a program created by the
                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in collaboration with the Technological Institute
                        and Superior Studies of Monterrey (ITESM) with the purpose of promoting the development of
                        computer science skills in high school girls. STEM fields are one of today’s world more
                        promising careers and Beautiful Patterns wants to inspire young girls by introducing them to
                        this and pushing them to reach their full potential doing whatever they choose. This is achieved
                        through one-week of immersive workshops taught by female engineering students, both from ITESM
                        and MIT.
                    </p>



                    <p>
                        To open our presentation we began with a quote by Marie Curie, “Nothing in life is to be feared,
                        it is only to be understood”, because we wanted to start with an example of a remarkable female
                        scientists, who undoubtedly has been an inspiration to many others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We explained what synthetic biology is, and how it has made a huge contribution in many areas of
                        our lives in the past decades. To elucidate this, as well as the amazing potential synthetic
                        biology has, it was shown its different applications in various fields, since making biosensors
                        all the way up to being a useful tool for space exploration. Simultaneously, we talked about
                        iGEM, its vision for synthetic biology, as well as our role in this year’s competition. We
                        mentioned our project briefly, the problem we were trying to solve, and examples of outstanding
                        projects from last year’s competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To close the presentation, we shared our contact information in case that someone was interested
                        in learning more about the topics we covered. A few days later, a teenage girl sent us a message
                        asking about the project and expressing her interest in the matter.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>
                        This experience left us energized. It gave us the opportunity to share something we are
                        passionate about to a group of people who are going through the same experience we went not so
                        far ago. We got to talk to such an enthusiast group of girls full of potential to try and spark
                        their interest and develop themselves in an area they are much needed; but actually getting a
                        direct response to this was more than motivating for us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We got to talk more personally with the girl who contacted us, where we could solve her many
                        questions, and introduce her a bit further into Synthetic Biology, iGEM, and our project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On August 1st we had the absolute pleasure to participate in Chihuahua’s Science Club’s
                        Symposium with a presentation titled “Inhibición del hongo Verticillium dahliae por Biología
                        Sintética” (“Inhibition of the fungus Verticillium dahliae through Synthetic Biology”), in front
                        of over 100 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Science Clubs International is a nonprofit organization founded in 2016 by Dr. Rogelio Hernández
                        López and Dr. Raúl Hernández Sánchez. Its mission is to “spark a social transformation by
                        expanding access to high quality STEM education and collaborative networks”.<sup><a
                                href="#ref2">2</a></sup> Their main
                        approach to achieving this is through a program called “Clubes de Ciencias”. In this program,
                        high school and college students participate in intensive summer workshops designed and taught
                        by young scientists specialized in the area and from prestigious institutions all over the
                        world. Some of the institutions that cooperate with Science Clubs are: Harvard, UCSF, Caltech,
                        MIT, ASU, Stanford, University of Chicago, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas
                        (Spain), Tecnatom (Spain), SENNOVA (Colombia), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil),
                        UNAM (Mexico), and ITESM (Mexico, our university).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The program is present in 7 countries from Latin America and Europe. Mexico has been working
                        with this organization since the first edition, looking to expand student’s access to high end
                        scientific education in an international level. Chihuahua, our city, has been participating
                        since 2017 with more than 100 participants every year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this summer’s edition we participated in its main event, the Symposium, where all the
                        researching professors who were part of the Clubs shared their current work. We presented about
                        how the team has been working with Synthetic Biology to inhibit the growth of Verticillium
                        dahliae for the iGEM Competition. Throughout our presentation we explained what synthetic
                        biology is, some of its current applications, its future potential, and how we are using it to
                        develop our project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Regarding our team and project we began with our previous achievements and the problem we
                        detected, and built up to the solution we were proposing, the methodology we were following, the
                        activities we had created for Integrated Human Practices and Public Engagement, the documents
                        developed for Entrepreneurship, and even our proposal for Mathematical Model. On this occasion,
                        we decided to save a space for the areas more recently developed since we had advanced a whole
                        lot since our last public talk; but our main reason was that we wanted our audience to be aware
                        that a project such as iGEM involves way more than just lab work. Our aim was to emphasize that
                        there are other areas essential for the project’s success, and most importantly, that they are
                        multidisciplinary, meaning anyone can participate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The audience included students from high school to college, research faculty, the club’s
                        organizers, and even the Science Clubs Mexico cofounder Dr. Raul Hernandez Sanchez. Their deep
                        curiosity led them to asking us many exciting questions like “how did you find the problem?” and
                        “how did you approach the producers?”.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is an incredible experience being part of this kind of events. We believe that people who are
                        interested in science should have a place where they can develop and strengthen their abilities
                        and interests, just as people new to science should have a place where they can delve deeper
                        into the matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being part of this and gaining a new perspective about biological science was rewarding because
                        you never know where you can find the next iGEMer. Also, speaking in front of PhDs from renowned
                        universities was not an easy task, but the result was impressive because at the end we ended up
                        feeling confident and encouraged; and we realized we should feel that way, since we have always
                        been talking about the subject we love the most: science.
                    </p>

                <h2>Conferences Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                    Participating in these events encouraged us to keep sharing our experience with science lovers. We
                    appreciated how the interaction was different, since it’s not the same being in a classroom
                    listening to
                    someone talk, to being in an event you attended on your own for pure pleasure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sharing these events with people who are passionate about the same topics that you is a priceless
                    experience, since far from you explaining something to them, the one who actually learns the most is
                    yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are endlessly grateful with M.S. Saúl Luján, PhD. Khallil Carreño and the ITESM organizers, who

                        Looking to involve more young people with no background within the scientific field, our team
                        decided to collaborate with 3 different United Nations models. To accomplish this we joined NGOs
                        and helped organize 3 events where a committee's main discussion topic was Synthetic Biology. As
                        an iGEM team and mexican citizens, we believe it’s of great importance that not only scientists
                        are involved in controversial matters with a technological basis, especially those that affect
                        society significantly. We also believe it’s important that they take a stand about what is going
                        on nowadays, because at the end of the day everyone is affected by these decisions.

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>

                    <p>
                        During the summer we had the chance of meeting the team of TecChMun to collaborate with them in
                        the
                        organization of their event, which took place on October 17, 18 and 19, and involved more than
                        200
                        people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This event consisted of a United Nations model that is held every year in the Tec de Monterrey
                        campus Chihuahua High School. The model’s dynamic is based on a series of debates that simulate
                        international organizations such as the UN or the WHO. Likewise, national gubernamental
                        organizations like the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are also simulated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Participants are mostly students who must take a stand regarding certain topics according to the
                        country, party, or charge they represent. After several debate sessions all the members of a
                        committee must reach a decision about the topic discussed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this edition we were in charge of organizing some of the discussion topics. Since our main
                        goal
                        was for there to be an open debate about Synthetic Biology, we chose to implement a topic for
                        the
                        World’s Health Organization committee. This topic was “Synthetic Biology in food”, specifically
                        focused on the use and development of transgenics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To complement this topic we also gave a small conference, where we introduced them to Synthetic
                        Biology and some of their applications, including transgenics. To illustrate this we used a
                        diagram
                        of what is genetic engineering and used golden rice as an example. Finally, to reinforce this
                        information, we shared with them a brief description of our project, from choosing the problem
                        to
                        our expected results. This was with the intention of easing the purpose of studying and
                        discussing
                        this topic.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        According with the opinions we received from some of the participants, the event left them very
                        interested with the current debated topics related to Synthetic Biology. At first, none of them
                        knew
                        what Synthetic Biology was about, which turned the research phase into a stimulating challenge.
                        They
                        had to learn something completely different to what they’re used to, but as they said “that only
                        made it more interesting and fueled the motivation”.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also realized how their perspective widened about a highly relevant topic. For us, as
                        Biotechnology students, is easy, to a certain degree, talking about these issues and even
                        analyzing
                        them in the lab. However, there are still many countries that remain closed toward these new
                        technologies, or that doesn’t count with the necessary regulations to apply them.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is that this activity was particularly exciting for us, since it was the one where the
                        participants learned the most. For teenagers to be talking about and analyzing these topics at
                        their
                        young age, motivated us to continue collaborating with them and involve even more people.

                    <h3>Event Description:</h3>

                    <p>
                        During this fall term we had the chance of collaborating with MUNMX in their event, which took
                        place
                        on October 11 and 12 in Saltillo, Coahuila, and where around 205 people participated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The event consisted of a United Nations model that involved Mexico’s whole northern region with
                        students from the different Tecnologico de Monterrey High Schools. Given that it’s an
                        interstatal
                        event, the hosting campus changes each year, and this 2019 was Saltillo’s turn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The program is not a regular UN model. It selects each campus top students to debate different
                        current and impactful topics. The participants must take a stand regarding the hypothetical
                        problematic discussed, once again depending on the nation they represent. By the end of the
                        model
                        they must write a resolution where all the participants agree on the international approach to
                        the
                        problematic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For this edition we were given the chance of organizing some of the discussion topics. We
                        proposed
                        Synthetic biology as the main discussion topic for the World Health Organization committee. The
                        focus of the topic was the future applications that could be developed, as well as the currently
                        existing options. Our goal with this debate was that participants delved into the world of
                        Synthetic
                        Biology so they could understand the benefits and setbacks of working with this specific branch
                        of
                        science. Additionally, we wanted them to perceive how it’s related to the real world and its
                        nations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To complement our collaboration we remained in touch with the committee’s organizers throughout
                        the
                        whole term to share with them an introduction about the topic. In it we described what is
                        Synthetic
                        Biology, as well as different applications, including biopesticides.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        What was most exciting for us from this event was that teenagers from different states from all
                        around the country participated. This means that we had a broader geographical reach. Something
                        of
                        great importance is the high possibility that, once all of them returned home, they shared their
                        experience and freshly gained knowledge.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For us, as university students, is enormously motivating to see young people interested by the
                        problem that our world faces. It’s great to see that their curiosity goes beyond and they take
                        part
                        in these events where they get to discuss topics outside of their comfort zone.

                    <p>
                        Throughout June, we had the pleasure of meeting several members of the organization “Actuemos
                        Hoy
                        A.C” (“Let’s Act Today”), who shared with us their work plan, which involved a UN model. For
                        this
                        event they expected college students from institutions from all over our state to participate.
                        At
                        the end, the model involved around 145 delegates from different universities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Actuemos Hoy A.C” is an NGO whose principal objective was to promote young adults involvement
                        into
                        world wide issues. They aspire to have a direct impact on public politics with their work. Just
                        as
                        strongly, they aspire to be an idea lab that promotes reflexion among the community of
                        Chihuahua.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This year we had the opportunity of collaborating with them in the UN model. Just as in the
                        other
                        models described previously, we helped in the organization of the discussion topics. We were
                        looking
                        for these college students to learn about what we’ve researched for the past nine months. With
                        this
                        in mind, we proposed the following discussion topics: gene therapy, genetically modified
                        organisms
                        (GMOs), and the anti-vaccination movement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To strengthen our collaboration we stayed in touch with the committee throughout the whole term.
                        During our meetings we got to talk with them about what Synthetic Biology is and some
                        applications
                        (mentioning our project as an example). We also provided them with a document of information
                        about
                        the three proposed discussion topics to ease the delegates’ initial research about the topic.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        It fills us with satisfaction that people unfamiliarized with scientific and impactful topics,
                        such
                        as these, dedicate a small effort to research and inform themselves about them. It is also
                        exciting
                        for us to know that they, as future graduates, will be aware of the social issues that arise
                        with
                        scientific advances, and will share this awareness with future generations.

                <p>
                    We thoroughly enjoyed this activity, since it was very motivating to see how these young people
                    involved themselves with science, and how they discovered things maybe they didn’t even imagine. It
                    is even more gratifying to know that all of this effort came from their own will, for the pleasure
                    of learning something new, understanding it and analyzing it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Another part of the experience we enjoyed was that not only did they committed to the understanding
                    of the technical concepts, but they also had to understand how countries all over the world are
                    living these situations and what they think about them. To take a nation’s stand is highly
                    complicated since you have to learn and comprehend its beliefs and culture.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This activity was one of the team’s favorites because, aside from promoting scientific
                    dissemination, it promoted something much more important and that most of the time is overlooked:
                    personal growth.

                    Trying to expand our goal of involving the greatest amount of people, involved and uninvolved with
                    science, the team created this section. The section is comprised of four different activities with
                    the objective of giving a twist to the conventional approach of the diffusion of Synthetic Biology.
                    Something very important for us was that our work could reach people with no access to the
                    previously described events. We tried our best to make sure this was accomplished.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The activities included are the following: a TV interview for Channel 28, attending the World Pepper
                    Convention, an editorial article published in “de Riego” magazine, and the creation of a student
                    group in our institution.

                    <p>
                        ABC NEWS 2-3, a television network operating in our state, was kind enough to offer us the
                        opportunity to be interviewed and talk about our project. The network broadcasts in Cuauhtémoc,
                        Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua and El Paso, Texas. Its audience ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 daily
                        viewers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In July, a reporter from ABC NEWS visited our lab, where the interview took place. We presented
                        our team and talked about our project and its development. During the interview we explained the
                        situation cotton crops are facing regarding Verticillium wilt. To illustrate this we described
                        the disease’s action mechanism and the economic repercussions it creates, both worldwide and in
                        our state. We also shared how our project is contributing to Synthetic Biology’s development.
                        Finally we explained how our project was developed to participate in iGEM, what the competition
                        is about and how Tec-Chihuahua has been part of it for 5 years. We chose to mention the work
                        realized on previous years, so that people could see that Synthetic Biology is not limited to
                        agriculture, but it is expanding into all areas possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This interview was broadcasted on TV and online (the link to the interview is attached below),
                        where people could get to know our work and the big problem that we are trying to solve.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        I was gratifying for us to share our project with so many citizens in Chihuahua. First of all
                        because we found out that even our own people don’t know that their state is the greatest cotton
                        producer in Mexico nor just how important this crop is. So, through interview we hoped people
                        gained awareness about this big problematic. Even if most of the audience is not directly
                        affected by Vertcillium wilt, there are lots of people who are, and they should know how the
                        disease works, and all the technological advances used to try and solve it. Overall, cotton is a
                        huge economic sector for our state, country and even the world, so everyone should have access
                        to this kind of information.

                    <p>
                        On July 4th, we had the opportunity to attend the 16th World Chili Convention held in the city
                        of
                        Chihuahua, the principal producer of chili in Mexico and the second one internationally.
                        We were especially excited to attend this convention because chilli crops are among the most
                        affected by Verticillium dahliae, the fungus we are trying to fight.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Secretariat of Rural Development (Secretaria de Desarrollo Rural), the government agency in
                        charge of promoting and supporting the agricultural, fishing and agroindustrial development of
                        the
                        country, was kind enough to invite us, after we told them about our project. The event included
                        a
                        lot of people involved in the chili industry, such as producers, buyers, technicians, scientists
                        and
                        business people, as well as government authorities like the State Governor and several members
                        from
                        the Chamber of Deputies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We assisted to different lectures about root biostimulation, innocuity, microbiology, and
                        parasitology in crops, where we obtained valuable information about how different fungi,
                        including
                        Verticillium dahliae, affect the development of chili.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the commercial area we could approach some of the agrochemical manufacturers that happen to
                        work
                        with fungi like ours. Here we also talked with producers of chilli and its seeds, who confirmed
                        wilt
                        caused by V. dahliae is extremely common in different crops. Through some of these
                        conversations, we
                        obtained information and contacts from agronomists whose tomato crops has suffered from this
                        disease
                        in the state of San Luis Potosí here in Mexico.

                    <p>
                        A national agricultural editorial called “de Riego” had a stand in the convention, and we had
                        the
                        chance to talk to their General Director about our project. He was particularly interested in
                        it,
                        and after talking with him for a while he offered us a space on their bimonthly magazine to
                        publish
                        an article about our work.

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        This convention was an unexpected turning point for our project. We had the fortune of leaving
                        with multiple contacts, who helped us throughout the rest of our project’s journey. But more
                        importantly, meeting so many relevant people in their area, hearing their perspectives, and
                        taking into account all of their insights, helped us mold our project to fit the most important
                        considerations they had to offer.

                        We had the pleasure of meeting the magazine’s General Director at the World Chili Convention,

                        about the product we were developing. Something that really sparked his interest was the
                        problematic we were focused on, since, as he told us, his magazine has never published about
                        Verticillium in cotton. By the end of our conversation he was so interested in our work that he
                        offered us the chance of publishing an article about his on his magazine.

                    <p>
                        In August, we began to work on the creation of this article and by September it was accepted for
                        its publication on December’s edition. The article addresses topics like: what is Synthetic
                        Biology, how is it being applied in agriculture, the benefits of said application, and an
                        explanation of our project as an example of this.

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>
                        It was of great importance for us to share with the agricultural community the benefits of
                        Synthetic Biology applied to this sector. After all, they are the ones that should be up to date
                        about the products and technologies developing in the market. Additionally, considering a future
                        development of the project, they represent a huge part of our potential customers.

                    <p>
                        LiFE (Leadership and Student Training) is a formative model for student life that seeks to
                        develop personal talent, leadership, and self-realization in the students. In LiFE, cultural,
                        sports, and personal development activities are encouraged through the creation of student
                        groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Every term, the Student Groups Fair takes place, where both student groups and student societies
                        are promote themselves and invite both high school and college students to join the community of
                        LiFE. For the team was very important to create a student group because it is an effective way
                        to gain major diffusion at our school. Additionally, being a student group allows you to create
                        events inside and outside of the institution, which gave us the chance to assist to all of the
                        other schools and develop fundraising activities. However, our main reason was that this allows
                        us to get other students interested in iGEM, which is of utmost relevance for us, given
                        multidisciplinarity in the team is essential.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the Student Fair, we built a stand about our project V-TION. In addition to this, we
                        presented
                        to the attending students, professors and staff, about the iGEM competition, previous years’
                        projects and what did our work involved this year. People showed interest in the team and asked
                        many questions we gladly answered about what was our project about, when did the competition
                        take place, how can they be part of the team, and when did the next competition’s registration
                        opens.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Takeaway:</h3>

                    <p>As students we often keep our focus only of the academic part of our lives because it’s what we
                        are used to. However, being a part of extracurricular activities encourages us to exit our
                        comfort zone and open up our mind; and this can have a huge positive impact on our personal
                        development. </p>
                    <p>Participating in this Student Fair allowed us to help other young students to discover a bit more
                        about themselves, because how could they know if they are interested in Synthetic Biology if
                        they’ve never heard of it? Likewise, as a student group, it was a pleasure to support science
                        diffusion within our institution. </p>
