                    than
                    inspired by the projects we read about. Learning about all the things that had been done only
                    reaffirmed
                    the notion that not even the sky was our limit. So what better idea than to use all these incredible

                </p>

                <p>
                    Our team is comprised of people who have lived most of their lives in the state of Chihuahua.
                    Knowing
                    our home and our people for so many years and in so many different aspects, we wanted to do
                    something
                    that would truly influence our community. We wanted to create a meaningful change in our
                    surroundings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before being part of iGEM Tec-Chihuahua 2019, some our team members had the chance to meet and work
                    with
                    people immersed in the rural area, while others had developed small research projects in our school
                    regarding agronomic issues; somehow all of us had some sort of experience with agriculture and its
                    importance for Mexican people.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Four our country, agriculture fulfills the nutritional needs of millions of citizens, preserves
                    natural
                    environments, stimulates progress by improving the quality of life in rural areas, and has also been
                    ingrained in our culture and traditions since the very beginning.<sup>7</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A certain concern seemed to stand out among the people our team members knew and had worked with.
                    Both
                    agronomic engineers and crop producers involved in the cotton agricultural business, mentioned
                    <i>Verticillium</i>, a phytopathogenic fungus that wilts their crops and has only worsened with
                    every new
                    season. This particular disease has been on of their major problems for more than 7 years, and still
                    they haven’t received any help about this whatsoever. This year the overall production is expected
                    to
                    lower considerably compared to previous seasons. One of the principal measures agricultors use as an
                    attempt to control this situation is applying great amounts of agrochemicals; representing a hazard
                    regarding soil, water and air pollution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, so far there is no product or efficient treatment to deal with this fungal infection.
                    Besides, the lack of proper methods to detect this disease in its earliest stages represent another
                    crucial concern.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to the above, we do believe that through synthetic biology we can reach a solution to the
                    inhibition
                    of <i>V. dahliae</i>, support of the most important sector of our region by improving the production
                    amount
                    and
                    preserving this valuable product that our state and our country produce and reducing fungicide
                    pollution
                    in consequence of toxic chemical components, in addition to help to decrease the suicide rate
                    because of
                    them.

                    <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> has a wide range of hosts, among which herbaceous plants and perennial
                    wood are
                    included, affecting more than 300 species, including cotton, strawberries, raspberries,
                    blueberries,
                    potatoes, lettuce, among others; even more importantly, its effects are
                    worldwide.<sup>8</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    China is the world’s second biggest cotton producer and Verticillium wilt’s rates have been
                    increasing
                    in
                    the past decade. <i>V. dahliae</i>, as well as another wilt disease, have had a great impact in the
                    country’s
                    cotton production, losing more than 150,00 tons per year.<sup>9</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, in the US, cotton wilt causes annual losses around 0.5% and 3.5% of the crops at a
                    national
                    level. In certain states, such as New Mexico, these rates have reached 5% and in Alabama, cropping
                    fields
                    have decreased 1.5% of its extension; these losses translate into roughly 3 million
                    dollars.<sup>10</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Speaking of Mexico, cotton production is highly important seeing that the amount produced accounts
                    for
                    80.67& of total national demand; in 2018, cotton production represented a profit over
                    $10,343,005,600
                    for
                    the country.<sup>11</sup> Chihuahua is the biggest cotton producer of Mexico with its yield being
                    70.2%
                    of all national
                    production.<sup>5</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, there is not any <i>Verticillium</i> specialized and aimed product, cotton producers turn
                    to the
                    conventional approach. They add agrochemicals to their crops, without any proper instructions and in
                    unawareness of the potential consequences. This elicits unwanted effects, such as elimination
                    non-target
                    organisms, and affectation of the food chain, high risks to the environment and human health. Even,
                    people
                    are being affected too, over 3 million agricultors suffer from serious poisoning, while 25 million
                    suffer
                    from mild poisoning.<sup>12</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also, trophic chains have been affected by this. A given example is the bee population reducing
                    29%-36%
                    due
                    to excessive use of triazoles.<sup>13</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another method employed to reduce <i>Verticillium</i> caused infections is crop rotation which
                    consists of
                    alternating plants with different nutritional needs in one place during different cycles, however it
                    can
                    result in disease propagation. Also, a frequent used technique is solarization, it refers to soil
                    disinfestation through the heat generated from the solar energy captured; nevertheless, despite its
                    positive
                    outcomes, demands a great amount of time.<sup>14</sup>

                    <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> is stimulated by humid soils and temperatures between 21°C and 27°C
                    (70°F-80°C). This
                    makes tropical and subtropical regions a suitable environment for its growth. The fungus can
                    overwinter as

                    It can be divided into three phases:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Latent phase:</strong> as a microsclerotia, made from melanin, Verticillium can survive in
                    the soil from a single
                    year to over two decades. Once roots exudates are found in the surrounding, the microsclerotia
                    starts to
                    germinate and spreads inside the plant through its mycelial form or as spores called microconidia.
                    Once
                    this happens, it travels into the plant’s vascular system, worsening the infection.<sup>16</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Parasitic phase:</strong> the fungus colonizes the plant’s structure, especially its roots
                    and stems,
                    producing
                    in turn more microsclerotia. Infected plant tissue turns necrotic since the vascular system is
                    obstructed with mycelia, conidias, and fungal metabolism byproducts. The pathogen itself produces a
                    glue-like substance that also obstructs the plant’s vessels, provoking water blockage and tissue
                    wilting.<sup>17</sup>

                <p>
                    <strong>Saprophytic phase:</strong> the plant dies, therefore the microsclerotia gets into the soil
                    and starts with the
                    cycle all over again.<sup>18</sup>

                    Usually, Verticillium wilt symptoms vary among hosts, but certain common symptoms can be pinpointed:
                    premature leaf chlorosis, necrosis and vascular discoloration in stems and roots.<sup>19</sup>

                    Looking forward to helping our environment and cotton industry, a systemic, preventive and treating
                    biofungicide using recombinant antifungal peptides as active ingredients is sought. So, in order to
                    fulfil our objective, the following methodology was designed with the purpose of turning our project
                    from an idea to reality.

                    <strong>BioBrick<sup>TM</sup> Desing:</strong> a total of five DNA sequences were designed to
                    express recombinantly the peptides
                    in <i>E. coli.</i> The constructs count with the essential parts needed for their correct
                    translation into
                    proteins, purification, and proper folding. Recombinant production of disulfide bonded peptides,
                    like PsDEF1 and WAMP1b, can be complicated in prokaryotic systems, thus we have as well created
                    DNA
                    sequences for the co-expression of these peptides with Erv1p, a disulfide bond forming
                    protein.<sup>20</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong><i>E. coli</i> Cells Transformation:</strong> Chemically competent <i>E. coli</i> cells
                    are prepared and transformed with
                    our vectors. <i>E. coli</i> BL21 (DE3) was chosen as a chassis for the expression of AtPFN1 for
                    being ideal
                    for protein expression. In the case of PsDef1 and WAMP1b, <i>E. coli</i> Shuffle, a specially
                    designed
                    strain to aid in the proper formation disulfide bonds, was chosen as an expression vector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>IPTG induced protein expression:</strong> After the cells are correctly transformed,
                    expression of the
                    peptides can be induced and controlled by Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG); BL21
                    (DE3)
                    and SHuffle are T7 expression strains. Once IPTG is added to these strains, T7 RNA polymerase is
                    produced and capable of transcribing downstream of promoters like those found in the DNA
                    constructs.<sup>21</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Soluble Protein Extraction:</strong> After induction and a period of incubation, cells
                    are lysed through
                    a
                    series of freeze/thaw cycles with the help of a lysis solution. The lysate is then centrifuged
                    to
                    obtain the cells soluble proteins in the supernatant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Protein Purification:</strong> Our peptides are designed to be expressed as fusion
                    proteins with a 6x
                    His-Tag. This allows the peptides to be purified through immobilized metal affinity
                    chromatography,
                    a purification procedure based on the interaction of metal ions with polyhistidine sequences in
                    tagged proteins.<sup>22</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Antifungal Assay:</strong> Next, the antifungal activity of the peptides is tested
                    against V. dahliae. A
                    spore suspension is treated with the purified peptides individually as well as a mixture of all
                    three of them to prove their collaborative effect against the fungus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Delivery:</strong> Nanoencapsulation has been shown to be a promising alternative to
                    deliver active
                    ingredients more efficiently and accurately. Our purpose is to get to nanoencapsulate
                    recombinant peptides, given they are the biofungicide’s active ingredients, using
                    chitosan-poly(lactide) copolymer capsule. <sup>23</sup>

                        kiharae.
                    </i> These antimicrobial peptides are also called hevein-like proteins due to their similarity to
                    hevein and to having a chitin binding site similar to chitinases.<sup>24</sup> The peptide’s action
                    mechanism
                    consists in the inhibition of fungalysins, fungal defense metalloproteases. Fungalysins cleave
                    chitinases, plant proteins that degrade chitin found in the fungal cell wal. <sup>25</sup> Since
                    <i>V. dahliae</i>
                    produces fungalysin.<sup>26</sup>, WAMP1b can be used to inhibit the fungus’ defense system, thus
                    suppressing its
                    pathogenicity.

                    important
                    mechanism for their antifungal action. It degrades spore and hyphal cell wall, then accumulating in
                    the
                    cytoplasm where it generates reactive oxygen species and induces apoptosis. AtPFN1 has been shown to
                    break down fungal cell walls, even when it is in its dormant, spore phase, ideally preventing the
                    spread

                <p>
                    PsDef1 stands for <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> Defensin 1, a plant defensin that has been shown to

                    the
                    fungal cell, effectively killing it from the inside.<sup>28</sup> Additionally, PsDef1 contains 4
                    disulfide

                    Once the nanoencapsulation is achieved, the product could be lyophilized and turned into wettable
                    powder
                    (WP). In this presentation it can be applied to the crops through the watering system. After a field
                    research, we realized people involved with the crops knew about new agricultural products through
                    their
                    technical assessor, who learned about them through distributors. Considering this informational

                    crops
                    producers, environment, etc…). Through interviews the producer’s wishes were validated and through
                    detailed consultation of NOMs like NOM-232-SSA1-2009 and NOM-045-SSA1-1993, the proposal of a
                    law-abiding project was sought. Likewise, a through risk analysis was developed, considering any
