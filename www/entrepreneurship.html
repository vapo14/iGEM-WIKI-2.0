            <p>
                By the 1990s, cotton production in our country was at
                point of disappearing due to a high incidence of crop pests, said problem
                caused the government to approve the introduction of biotechnology for its cultivation and since 1996
                genetically modified cotton has been farmed. The variety of cotton grown today is FiberMax. This variety
                has the ability to resist insects, so it is used
                to control "acorn worm" and the "pink worm"; it also exerts some control over other worms like the
                "soldier"
                and the "false meter"; likewise, it is resistant to glyphosate herbicides and
                glufosinate, being useful for managing weeds without affecting cotton cultivation.<sup><a href="#refEntreOne">1</a></sup>
                However, resistant varieties that are currently used are susceptible
                to other diseases such as Verticillium wilt. This is the most important disease in the main cotton
                producing
                regions because it affects 20% of its production and decreases product quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most serious symptom for this disease is the irreversible wilt of
                the whole plant after several weeks of vegetative growth, followed by death
                of the plant. Sometimes wilting only affects some stems or leaves, causing visible symptoms such as
                sectoral
                chlorosis and tissue necrosis.<sup><a href="#refEntreTwo">2</a></sup> The spread of <i>Verticillium
                    dahliae</i>,
                fungus responsible for the disease, is
                through currents of air, irrigation, tillage instruments or insects. Some methods proposed to control
                the
                pathogen include a deep plow of the earth, rotation of crops using non-susceptible species and balanced
                fertilization avoiding excess nitrogen or lack of potassium.<sup><a href="#refEntreThree">3</a></sup>
                Currently there is no chemical control that is
                effective against <i>Verticillium Dahliae</i>.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a result we firmly believe that it is an important issue and that it must be attended because despite
                having high yields in production, the state of Chihuahua still imports 50% of national demand, a
                percentage
                that can be lowered if we manage to combat <i>Verticillium Dahliae</i>. This is where V-TION, a
                preventive and
                treatment fungicide comes into play.

                <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In order to know more about the current situation of cotton farms, we had to contact people
                    who
                    worked on the industry. We visited local government associations as well as agricultural
                    engineers
                    in several places around our region. We found that they struggled with Verticillium Wilt in
                    every
                    farm that we visited. When we told the producers and engineers about our project and our
                    potential
                    solution they were immediately interested to know more about how we were going to deal with
                    this
                    illness. Some of them even offered us part of their crops for testing our product once we
                    had
                    the
                    final result. This experience was exhilarating; not only did we learn about the illness's
                    effects,
                    but we also felt committed to keep in touch with them in hopes of solving this problem.

                <h3>Define</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By exploring the cotton industry and its whole process, we were able to define our target
                    market.
                    Based on what the producers told us about Verticillium Wilt and its effect on their farmland
                    we
                    were
                    committed to adapt our solution to their needs. This meant that the application method and
                    overall
                    use of the product had to be adapted accordingly. We found out about how we can distribute
                    our
                    product, and even made connections for potential customers.
                </p>

            <section id="content3">
                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By now we had a solid idea of what we wanted to accomplish. Our goal was to create a product
                    that
                    was specialized for Verticillium Wilt in cotton crops. Now we had to visualize how the final
                    product
                    would be fabricated. For this we began researching about nanoencapsulation (link to document
                    on
                    wiki). Our product now began to take shape. The next step was to define the amount of
                    ingredients
                    per package, the application method and the infographic for how to apply the product. For
                    the
                    ingredients we based our implementation on similar products. The application method was
                    defined
                    to
                    be through irrigation. This decision was based upon the interviews we had with the
                    engineers.
                    Finally the infographic was developed and the overall product was almost done. Now all we
                    needed
                    was
                    the design.

                <br>
                <p>
                    For our initial prototype we decided to look into the legal aspect of our product packaging.
                    After
                    researching and consulting we found that our product package had to comply with certain
                    legal
                    regulations. In order to ensure that everything was in order, we implemented this as part of
                    our
                    legal plan. We aimed at designing the most realistic prototype possible so that there was no
                    room
                    for doubt. This included complying with safety regulations, ingredients of the product
                    itself,
                    instructions for appropriate use among many others. Scroll down to the product section of

                    lend
                    us. That way we can test our product in the real world and see how it would react in
                    different
                    environments such as weather, temperature and soil. It is a great opportunity that we
                    weren’t
                    even
                    counting on until the agricultural engineers suggested it. The other benefit this kind of
                    testing is
                    that our potential customers can see the results for themselves.

                    Once our project is more developed and our product has proven functionality, we plan to
                    implement it
                    in the cotton crops that we visited during our investigation. The producers were invested
                    enough
                    to
                    sign a commitment letter that allows us to work with them in the future.

                In order for V-TION to become a prospering company we have to work together with different entities to
                create a sustainable business. This includes sales agents, who are in charge of establishing valid
                contracts with providers and/or consumers. We also count with a transport company for our product
                deliveries to the distributors. Another entity that we are allied with is a packaging and labeling
                company; that way we don’t have to worry about this process ourselves and we can focus on improving our
                current products or creating new ones. We must also keep in touch with non-governmental organizations to
                monitor the activity on crops and be aware of any product trends or new problems that we can potentially
                solve.

                or any contacts in common, or we can contact them through assemblies, networking presentations, among
                other events in the business. In one way or another, a direct link is obtained with the distributor and
                a contract is made to obtain distribution benefits.

            <h2>Revenue Stream</h2>
            <p>
                Strategy: Sales will be made through direct contact of our company with the client. We will try to
                establish an annual sales contract with financing and credit lines with a payment term of 60 to 90 days.
                The freight price will not be included in the product’s price, an additional charge would be made for
                the product’s transport from our warehouse to the distributor's warehouse. Once the distributor sells
                the product, 5% of the proceeds will go to the distributor and the rest to V-TION.

            <p>
                Our team will have initial costs, including the rent of an equipped laboratory and warehouse, the cost
                for the product’s nanoencapsulation, packaging and labeling costs; and we also considered the cost for
                freight of our product. For this, we established tentative manufacturing costs, such as
                nanoencapsulation, formulation, packaging, and labeling. Our company also contemplates marketing costs,
                such as advertisements on social networks and other media, in addition to the necessary investment in
                human capital.

                We started by contacting associations in our city in charge of the agricultural sector. These people
                then
                led us
                to more contacts all over the state. Also, taking advantage of the fact our state is an agricultural
                production
                leader, we could quickly find contacts in other leading states in cotton production, Baja California Sur
                and
                Sonora. With this approach we could extend our proposal to an international level, validating our market
                opportunity and potential customers in Canada.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our new contacts allowed us to understand the problem from their point of view and offer them an
                effective
                solution especially customized to their needs. This empathy allowed us to make product related decisions
                that
                benefited the customers directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude our national validation, we received feedback from the engineer Sergio Montijo, who
                confirmed
                our hypothesis about our potential competitors and the distribution channel we would use nationally.
            </p>

            <p>
                As for the International Validation of the issue we reached out to the Canola Council of Canada where
                they
                reported to be working with Verticillium Longisporum. From there we were able to rectify that
                Verticillium
                Dahliae affects crops in Canada such as potatoes.

                We also had the chance to contact the president of “Sistema Producto Algodón” and with the Chihuahua
                State
                Plant
                Health Committee. They provided us with relevant data about the annual state’s production, its cost and
                the
                economic income to the country through the import and export of cotton.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through the contact we established with the Plant Health Committee, information regarding the main pests
                and
                diseases that affect cotton production was obtained. They also shared a field and national-level
                validation
                of
                the severity of this issue and how V. dahliae can impact the fiber’s quality.

                We went to Janos and Ojinaga, major cotton production regions in our state, where we could talk with
                agronomic engineers. They are in constant touch with the crops and have to be fully aware of the
                agricultural products in the market since they are the ones who advise the producers in this area. In
                addition to this, we realized just how much trust exists between producer and engineer which helped us
                define who are our clients and how our market works.
            </p>

            <p>
                The interview with engineer Carlos Zabala, who is in charge of the purchase, sale and negotiation of the
                crops in Janos, made us realize how the product reaches consumers. Fortunately, he knows both the market
                of
                cotton crop supplies and how they should be managed.
            </p>

            <p>
                We learned about the method of application of fungicides, as well as the way in which products reach
                consumers. Another important contribution was how the finances between company and distributor are
                managed.
                This opened up a whole new panorama for our market and financing strategy.

                    Within the framework of the innovation week we attended the pitch to sharks where different
                    entrepreneurs from the state of Chihuahua presented their projects to five investors. The investors
                    of that module are currently directors of important companies in the country. The main knowledge we
                    acquired was negotiation strategies and at the same time the requirements to win an investment. We
                    understood that it is important to have a scalable project, have a well-validated business model
                    know clearly and precisely the market you wish to enter and have in mind strategies to avoid
                    competition to your market.

                    minds to a new kind of opportunities of market. We have the pleasure of being working around social
                    organizations that share with us their project and ideas so among all think about social strategies
                    that can have a positive achievement. During the day we elaborate deliverables for the different
                    validations of the project and at the same time we receive feedback of each part we develop. He
